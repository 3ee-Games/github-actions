# 3ee Games Issue Tracker GitHub Actions

Welcome to the 3ee Games Issue Tracker GitHub Actions repository! This repository is part of our commitment to providing transparency to our players and community, showcasing the ongoing work we do to improve our games and services. By tracking issues, bugs, enhancements, and other tasks automatically, we aim to keep everyone informed about the development process.

## Purpose

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically tracks and updates the status of various issues within the 3ee Games repository, including:

- **Bug Reports**
- **Documentation Issues**
- **Enhancements**

This process provides transparency to our players and ensures they know that we are actively working to address any issues or improvements needed in our games.

## Features

- **Automatic Tracking:** Issues are tracked daily based on labels such as `bug`, `documentation`, and `enhancement`.
- **Transparency:** Every change made is automatically documented in the issue-count JSON file.
- **Confidence:** Builds confidence in the players that the development team is actively working on game-related issues.

## Benefits

- **Keeps players informed:** Our players can see the status of issues being tracked and resolved.
- **Builds trust:** Transparency in issue tracking shows our commitment to quality and continuous improvement.
- **Helps the dev team:** Automates issue tracking, allowing the team to focus on solving issues rather than managing the issue list.
